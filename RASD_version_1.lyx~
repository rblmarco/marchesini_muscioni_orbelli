Scenario 9
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today Guido has an important meeting with a society that is interested in
 the application of the new renewable energy.
 To share the principles of that new technology company he decides to try
 the service develop by the PowerEnjoy society, which allowed, with a simple
 subscription to its website, to use an electric car.
 After Guido registers in the system, he reserved a car near his home from
 the website.
 Reached the car, he starts his ride and, because the office of the society
 is near his home, he arrives at destination in about 10 minutes.
 The system detects that the car still has 80% of battery so, it applies
 20% discount to the cost of the ride because the user has left more than
 50% of the battery.
 Once comes back home, Guido sees on the website how much he spent, and
 he sees the discount of his ride as well.

Scenario 10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paola decides to reserve a car to go to the train station to wait for one
 of her friends coming to Milan to look for a job.
 Because her friend Margherita has some baggage, she reserved an electric
 car, using the PowerEnjoy application.
 When she arrives at the station, she sees on the screen of the car that
 the parking area of the station is one of the “special parking area”.
 So, she immediately decides to park in this area, knowing that she can
 obtain a discount if she plugs the car.
 Plugged it, she goes to the right platform to wait for Margherita and she
 receives a notify from the app about the final fare with the 30% discount.

Scenario 11
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is Sunday morning and Marco needs to go to San Siro Stadium to watch
 the match between Milan against Inter.
 He is late, so he decides to reserve an electric car to drive in the preferenti
al lane, avoiding the traffic.
 He opens the PowerEnjoy application and he reserves a car.
 Marco knows that near the stadium there is a “special parking area”, but
 when he arrives he notices that this area is closed due to security purposes.
 So, he is forced to park the car 3 km away from the special area and, because
 the initial level of battery was more than 70%, he pays the charges of
 30% more in the cost of the ride.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Scenario 12
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is Sunday and Jack with his family decides to go to the hippodrome.
 They decide to use an electric car so Jack opens the PowerEnjoy applications
 and reserve it.
 He drives until the stadium, but, because of the traffic, the battery level
 goes down 20%.
 Marco has taken the car with a level battery better than 70% and he does
 not recharge the car.
 Therefore, when he finishes the ride, the system applies a fee, about 30%
 of the cost of the ride, to compensate for the cost required to charge
 the car on site.
